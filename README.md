# Parking Management System


Parking Management System is a Java GUI-based application for handling booking outdoor parking spaces within the city.

## Background: 
The Toronto Parking Authority operates over 17,500 parking spots across Toronto. Approximately,
10,000 of these spaces are by 2,000 ticket meters and the additional 7,500 by single space meters. Currently, a
customer either purchases a ticket from the machine and places it on the carâ€™s dashboard or inserts coins into a single
spot meter. Employees have to walk weekly to collect money from these 9,500 locations. Additionally, the Toronto
Police Service offers parking enforcement via dispatched personnel who randomly select areas to monitor. These personnel need to check tickets or parking meters manually and issue tickets as needed. In order to minimize the
number of locations to collect money, the Toronto Parking Authority wants to develop an online platform to process
payment for select spaces where single parking meters are currently used. The spaces will be numbered and the
registered customer can select the space number from their device online to initiate payment.
